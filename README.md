# Introduction
This was a DARPA funded research done at MIT Lincoln Laboratory to develop an intrusion detection system. Data is publicly available at MIT Lincoln Laboratory website and the University of California, Irvine. With my background in data and voice communication, this was an interesting subject for my capstone. However, my main focus was identifying only DoS attacks. Original data was never labeled as DoS attack, instead, they were labeled as different variations of DoS attack such as smurf, teardrop, neptune and more. I was most interested in building machine learning models to identify DoS connection in general irrespective of their variations.

# Problem Statement
Detect denial of service connections give TCP/IP header information, different types of error rates and other traffic-related data such as duration, protocol etc
